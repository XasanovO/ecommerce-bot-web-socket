# ecommerce-bot-web-socket

This repository contains an e-commerce application that integrates a Telegram bot and a web interface, leveraging WebSocket technology for real-time updates.

## Overview

In this application, users can place orders via a Telegram bot, 
and these orders are immediately displayed on an operator's web page.
The operator can update the order status by dragging and dropping the order, 
changing its status in real-time. Users receive notifications about their 
order status through the bot.

## Key Features

- **Telegram Bot Integration**: Users can place orders directly through the bot.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Orders are displayed in real-time on the web page using WebSocket technology.
- **Order Management**: Operators can drag and drop orders to change their status (e.g., accepted, completed).
- **User Notifications**: Users are notified of order status changes through the bot.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How It Works

1. **Order Placement**: Users place orders via the Telegram bot.
2. **Real-Time Display**: The order is immediately displayed on the operator's web page through WebSocket.
3. **Status Update**: Operators can change the order status by dragging and dropping the order.
4. **Notification**: Users receive a notification via the bot when the order status is updated.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained valuable insights into the practical 
implementation of WebSocket for real-time communication and the integration 
of bot and web functionalities within a single application. This project 
allowed me to deeply understand WebSocket technology as I practiced 
and developed the code.
